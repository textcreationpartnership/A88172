            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>BUt while I was concluding this second edition of the London Agents plea, with the fore-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed additions, newes is brought me that the Committee of plundred Ministers, summons up <hi>Londoners</hi> and commits them for none payment of Tythes; for whom I frame a Plea thus. That the houses of Parliament, have already made two Ordinances about Tythes of the 8. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem.</hi> 1644. and the 9. of <hi>August,</hi> 1647. &amp; by those Ordinances referred the <hi>London</hi>-Parsons, or Ministers in London, to get their Tyhes according to the statute of the 37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 12. which Statute authoriseth such, and such men to be Commissioners therein nominated, or any six of them to make a decree, which decree shall be as binding to the <hi>Londoners</hi> as an expresse act of Parliament, in which they give the Parsons <hi>two shillings nine-pence in the pound,</hi> for all house rents, &amp;c. which the Londoners are bound to pay unto their Parsons, if the said Decree had (as by the foresaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it ought to have been) entered upon record in the High Court of Chancery, which it never was nor is not there to be found <hi>as Mr.</hi> Narborow <hi>the Lawyer in Roben-Hoods Court in Bow-Lane London, proved by Certificate under the record Keepers hand, before Alderman</hi> Adams, <hi>when he was Lord Major of London;</hi> in a case betwixt Parson <hi>Glendon</hi> of Barkins by Tower-Hill, and one of his Parishoners, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> a Marchant, as I remember, for I was by and heard all the Plea.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Parsons of London, can neither by law nor those Ordinances, recover or justly require, one farthing token of tythes from any Citizen of London.</p>
            <p>And for the Committee of plundered Ministers by any pretended authority that yet is visible, to take upon them to execute those Ordinances, or to compell the Citizens of London to pay tythes to their Parsons or Ministers, they have no more authority, or right to do it, then a Theefe hath upon the high way to Rob me of my Purse, or life, and for them by the Law of their own will, to take upon them to send Summons to any freeman of England, and to force them to come before them; and without due processe of<note n="*" place="margin">And what due processe of Law is, you may read in the 2 part instituts upon the 29 Chap. of Magna Charta, and vox plebis pag. 11, 12, 14, 15, &amp;c. and my booke called The resolued mans resolution, page 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. and my grand Plea against the Lords, and <hi>Thompsons</hi> Plea against the new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By Authority, The constant forme of the inditement, in that case for escape, either by the Party, or voluntarily suffered by the Goaler, is, That he was arrested <hi>[for suspicion of a certaine felony,</hi> namely, <hi>for the death of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
